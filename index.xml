With the upcoming new GitHub Actions feature, I was very excited to test it, so I immediately signed up for the beta access and finally my invitation had been accepted.

Boring introduction As a part-time Rubyist, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t ignore Crystal any longer (+ I enjoy learning new programming languages) so I decided to give it a try. Because I wanted to write something useful and contribute to the community, I was looking for a small idea in the Ruby world and spoiler alert… I found it.</description></item><item><title>Slides: Graphing - Minimal guide to graph databases</title><link>https://qbart.dev/posts/2017/slides-graphing-minimal-guide-to-graph-databases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2017 13:15:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qbart.dev/posts/2017/slides-graphing-minimal-guide-to-graph-databases/</guid><description>Presentation about Neo4j.</description></item><item><title>Slides: Database integrity vs. Rails (Revised)</title><link>https://qbart.dev/posts/2015/slides-database-integrity-vs.-rails-revised/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2015 13:15:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qbart.dev/posts/2015/slides-database-integrity-vs.-rails-revised/</guid><description>Presentation about foreign keys and constraints.</description></item><item><title>Slides: My new fav things in pgSQL 9.3/9.4</title><link>https://qbart.dev/posts/2015/slides-my-new-fav-things-in-pgsql-9.3/9.4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2015 13:15:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qbart.dev/posts/2015/slides-my-new-fav-things-in-pgsql-9.3/9.4/</guid><description>Presentation about filtering and lateral join.</description></item><item><title>Slides: Don’t use three state boolean</title><link>https://qbart.dev/posts/2015/slides-dont-use-three-state-boolean/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 13:15:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qbart.dev/posts/2015/slides-dont-use-three-state-boolean/</guid><description>Presentation about abusing boolean values in database.</description></item><item><title>My MSc thesis: Dynamic gamification in project management</title><link>https://qbart.dev/posts/2013/my-msc-thesis-dynamic-gamification-in-project-management/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2013 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qbart.dev/posts/2013/my-msc-thesis-dynamic-gamification-in-project-management/</guid><description>Presentation about my MSc Thesis.

I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer currently working at Selleo. I specialize in backend development, databases and devops. As a hobby I develop video games in SoftKiwi and play bunch of board games. I am also into sound design, Artificial Intelligence, game jams (GGJ/LD) and learning new programming languages. From time to time I tinker with Raspberry Pi.</description></item></channel></rss>
